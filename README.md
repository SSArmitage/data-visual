# data-visual

A full-stack application that implements rate limiting server-side and displays data via graphs client-side. Built using React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL
(curve fitting the data was done using Python).\
Note: the only graphs that are currently displaying are Total Events vs. Date & Average Events vs. Hour.\
Note: graph logic still needs to be abstracted.
