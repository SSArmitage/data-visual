# data-visual

A full-stack application that I built while playing around with back-end technologies. It implements rate limiting server-side and grabs data from an API and displays it via graphs client-side. Built using React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL
(curve fitting the data was done using Python).\
Note: the only graphs that are currently displaying are Total Events vs. Date & Average Events vs. Hour.\
Note: the graph choice logic is a bit convoluted at the moment, it still needs to be abstracted.
